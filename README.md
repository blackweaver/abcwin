ABCshow its a free to use library created by [Ricardo Castillo](http://www.ricardocastillo.com), [ABCdisegno.com](http://www.abcdisegno.com) CEO (Spanish speaking Design, programming and creativity community), this library allows you to enhance images at first sight, as well as YouTube and Viemo videos. It's ideal for a picture gallery, or to zoom in particular images, like a news related shot. Also allows the same with videos from YouTube; just by knowing the reference code of each video, you can show small captures of it, and place them at first hand with any size you choose!.
